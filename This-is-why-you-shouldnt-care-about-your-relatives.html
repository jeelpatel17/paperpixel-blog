            Especially in India, relatives can be very hard to handle. I mean, they are just drawing the
            youth down for not following certain rules or not doing certain things! I’ve felt it so many times that my
            relatives are insulting me in front of everyone saying ‘you are too thin/fat, eat more/less’, I mean, Who
            are you making decisions of my life, It’s my life, I have a family to take care of me, who the hell are
            you?!
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">People not believing in your dreams is like a disease nowadays!</h2>
            Recently a month ago, I was in my hometown and I was at a relative’s house, that’s where I got a huge amount
            of fuel (motivation), let me tell you how, but let’s define a variable first, relative = 'a relative
            person', now it’s good. So, I was at my relative’s house for vacations (as my cousin also lives there),
            we were sitting and talking, and suddenly a talk came up with airplanes and stuff like abroad, and as of a
            sudden, my relative said that “being on an airplane will just be in your dreams”, that’s when my amygdala (a
            brain part,which's size defines how much your anger will be)
            was filled with a lot of lava, but as we know, a typical Indian home is that you can’t argue with a relative
            or any other elder as it doesn’t follow ‘sanskar (ethics)’ in your family, and that’s also how I was
            nurtured, and
            till date whenever I see an airplane in the sky(every time I hear an airplane’s voice, I just leave all my
            work and run like a mad to see that tiny airplane in the skies and every time I watch it I make a commitment
            to myself that I’ll ride that thing one day, and if I got enough opportunities, then I’ll not hesitate in
            buying that whole damn plane! But, if I talk about my family and my relatives, I was really special (not
            disabled like special) and different from other children, I’ve always admired Steve Jobs over Shakira and
            Mark Zuckerberg over Megan Fox, While every one of my age was busy playing PUBG, I was learning soft skills
            and constantly improving myself, bragging aside, let’s get to the moral of the blog, and that’s so simple,
            <br><br>
            ‘Just prove everybody wrong, and let the Karma decide who will get what’ That’s all! Once you master
            that art, You’ll win, mark my words!
