            Everyone has had that boring and arrogant principal or teacher while in primary school and have a hateful
            relationship with their principal because they’re being strict and schooly things like that. I was also one
            of a kind like that, but after I completed my primary school and now I’m in a college, I’ve realized that
            there were certain lessons from my primary school principal which I ignored were making a lot of sense and
            were depicting the world’s scenario, and how the world works! I’m gonna share those lessons with you, so you
            can also tell them to your child or your loved ones’ child.
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">1. ‘Whoever wants to do, does!’</h2>
            I’m sure that you’d not get this one right away after reading it, give me a chance! So, I still remember
            that my principal used to this phrase every time we children were doing some kind of mischief or not good at
            studies, but now I realized what she was trying to say, that is ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way!’. I
            realized that if anyone wants to do something or achieve some goal, he/she achieves it, without any excuses
            and arguments, just pure will power and dedication!
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">2. ‘My Life is Blank White Paper and it died like a Blank White Paper’</h2>
            My principal was reciting this maybe 3–4 times a day (not in English, but Hindi — Mera jivan kora kagaz,
            kora hi reh gaya), but it did pay off! (to some students at least). Let me tell you what she’s trying to
            convince with this, she use to tell that our lives are like a blank paper and our actions are like the
            letters on it, the moment we’re born, the almighty God sanctions a fresh warm blank paper from a printer,
            and now you’ve to fill it nicely with good deeds and with golden letters to be a role model for someone, and
            whenever I remember this, my brain also bombs out a famous quote of ‘unknown’
            <br><br>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                " Your Life is Your Message to the World, Make Sure it’s Inspiring "
            </blockquote>
            She also used to say in its full version in Hindi — “ Mera jivan kora kagaz kora hi reh gaya, hawa ka
            jhaunka aaya aur udd gaya! ”, English translated — “ My life is a blank white paper, and when an air gust
            blew, it flowed like the trash in a hurricane.” So, don’t waste your lives partying and gossiping with
            friends, make sure your life’s paper isn’t blank on the death bed, fill it with good deeds, and don’t let
            any wind gust to blow your life’s paper into the never-ending hurricane of negativity.
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">3. Whose problem is it?</h2>
            Whenever I use to forget my homework notebook at home and tell her that the very next day, she used to scold
            me with that phrase, “Whose problem is it?” and every time I used to hate her more and more because I didn’t
            know that simple phrase will teach me some lesson later in my life, now I realize that in the real world, if
            you haven’t done something, maybe you’ve gone for an interview and forgot your needed documents, you aren’t
            going to tell the hr officer that you forgot those documents at home, it is not his problem, that is your
            problem that you forgot them at home, that was the lesson I got earlier in my primary school. If my homework
            wasn’t available, then that was ultimately my problem!
            <br><br>
            Now after ~3 years, I realize how she was teaching me the important aspects of life, and training me to face
            it.
